                Hello, everybody! My name is Jieming Gan, a sophomore at International Academy Central, and the creator of this web page. Michigan A+ttorney is a compilation of the various laws and courtroom procedures of Michigan. The web page includes a simplified version of the Michigan Constitution, a basic guide to terminology associated with criminal and civil cases, information on the different parts of trials, and finally, a quiz to test your knowledge! 
            </p>

                I made this website for my sophomore year Personal Project. My goal throughout this project is to learn more about the legal system of Michigan, which is a field I'm passionate about, and how to code an HTML website from scratch, a skill I have little prior experience with. This website is my way of sharing to everyone the knowledge I've acquired through my process.
