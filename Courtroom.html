                WHAT IS A COURT?            
            </p>    
            <p class="box2">
                Courts are bodies that settle disputes in the United States. They interpret the law and apply those interpretations to resolve disagreements between parties.

                WHAT TYPES OF COURTS ARE THERE?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                In Michigan, the three main types of courts are the supreme court, courts of appeals, and trial courts. Trial courts are where most cases start out, and where they are usually resolved. Courts of appeal review cases from trial courts. The supreme court is the last resort, where cases end up for a final ruling.

                WHAT TYPES OF CASES ARE THERE?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                Cases on a broad level are split up into criminal and civil cases. Civil cases involve legal disputes between two or more parties, whereas criminal cases involve instance in which law has been broken.

                HOW DO COURT CASES WORK?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                In a criminal trial, there is a prosecutor, who attempts to convince the court with evidence and testimonies that the defendant is guilty of a crime. The defense lawyer and the defendant attempt to use evidence and testimony to convince the court that the accused is not guilty. Civil cases work slightly differently; they occur when two or more parties come across a legal disagreement. The party that starts the case is called the plaintiff, and the other party is called the defendant. The point of civil cases is to settle the dispute.

                WHO IS INVOLVED IN A COURT CASE?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                Many people are involved in a court case. There is always a judge, someone who regulates the court and ensures that procedures are being followed correctly. There is also a jury, a body usually composed of twelve impartial jurors. The duty of the jury is to deliberate based on the evidence presented before them and come up with a verdict. Lawyers represent the disputing parties, presenting evidence and arguments to convince the court that their side is accurate. In criminal cases, the prosecutor is the party accusing the other party of a crime, and the accused party is the defendant. In civil cases, the party that starts the case is the plaintiff, and the other party in the dispute is the defendant.

                WHAT EVENTS LEAD UP TO A CRIMINAL COURT CASE?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                In a criminal case, someone must be charged with a crime for the trial to continue forward. After the defendant is charged, there is an initial hearing where they are informed of their rights and the charges against them. The defendant may be held in prison while awaiting trial, or released until then, depending on the severity of the crime. During the initial hearing, the defendant is asked to plead guilty or not guilty. The defendant may be offered a plea deal, which means their sentence may be reduced in return for pleading guilty to the crime. Should the defendant plead not guilty, the next step in the process is the preliminary hearing. This must be held within 14 days of the defendant's initial appearance if they are being held in jail, and 21 days if they are held on bail. Evidence is presented and witnesses testify, and the judge decides whether or not the trial should move forward. If the judge believes the defendant most likely didn't commit the crime, they might dismiss the charges, and if they believe the defendent likely committed the crime, they will schedule a trial.

                WHAT IS THE GENERAL PROCEDURE IN CRIMINAL CASES?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                Criminal cases begin with an opening statement, where the attorneys representing both parties summarize their position to the court. After that, witness examination begins. Both sides call up witnesses. The prosecutor begins direct examination of their witness, presenting evidence and arguments to convince the court of the defendant's guilt. The defense lawyer then cross examines those witnesses to find cracks in their story. The process then repeats with the defense lawyer performing direct examination on their witnesses and the prosecution cross examining those witnesses. Afterwards, both sides give closing arguments, where both the prosecution and the defense summarize their arguments. Finally, the jury deliberates and comes up with a verdict or guilty or not guilty for the defendant.

                WHAT EVENTS LEAD UP TO A CIVIL COURT CASE?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                The plaintiff first must file a complaint to initiate a lawsuit, with the defendent filing an answer to said complaint, stating why the lawsuit should not prevail. The judge will produce a timeline of events and both parties prepare for trial. Sometimes, the judge may grant a preliminary conjunction, which is an order to do or not to do something in order to prevent irreparable harm to a person, animal, or property before the final resolution of a case. Finally, a jury is selected, and there may be multiple hearings before the trial begins.

                WHAT IS THE GENERAL PROCEDURE IN CIVIL CASES?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                Civil cases proceed in a manner similar to criminal cases, the only fundamental difference being that the judge and jury try to settle a dispute rather than convict the defendant of a crime. Both parties present their opening statements, containing their positions on the matter. Witnesses and evidence are called up, and the prosecution and defense each perform direct and cross examinations. Finally, closing statements are heard before the jury deliberates and comes up with a verdict to settle the lawsuit. The parties may also waive their right to a verdict, in which case the judge assumes the powers that would otherwise have been granted to the jurors.

                HOW DO OBJECTIONS WORK?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                In a courtroom, objections are used by lawyers to call out questions or conduct that aren't in line with courtroom regulation and procedures. There are many different types of objections, with some common ones being: argumentative, when the question asked is making an argument, badgering, when the lawyer is overly aggressive to the witness, incompetence, when the witness lacks sufficient knowledge to answer a question, leading, when the question calls for an assertion from the witness, repetitive, when the question has been answered already, and speculative, when the question requires the witness to speculate about something. A judge can either sustain, or accept an objection, or overrule it.

                HOW DOES SENTENCING WORK IN A CRIMINAL CASE?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                Following a guilty verdict, the judge delivers a sentence, or punishment, to the defendant. Many crimes already have minimum and maximum sentences provided by law, but the judge may also modify the sentence based on the mental state of the victim, if the victim is a repeat offender, if they display regret for their actions, or the nature of the crime.

                HOW DO APPEALS WORK?
            </p>
            <p class="box2">
                A defendant can appeal to a circuit court if they believe they were wrongfully convicted or unfairly sentenced. They present possible errors that might have occured during their trial. The case could return back to trial, or the verdict or sentence could be altered.
